# IAB Responsibilities Tracking

This repository tracks the responsibilities and tasks assigned to IAB members
between board meetings. See details on the [committee model](https://wiki.ietf.org/group/iab/committee-model).

See the current year's full board meeting schedule [here](https://wiki.ietf.org/group/iab/2025_Schedule).

See the agenda for informal meetings [here](https://wiki.ietf.org/group/iab/Agenda).

An overview of all tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/intarchboard/projects/2/views/1).

## How do I add a task to track?

- Create an [Issue](https://github.com/intarchboard/responsibilities/issues) to track a task or responsibility that you or others will work on between full board meetings.
- Assign one or more IAB members to the issue.
- Set the [Label](https://github.com/intarchboard/responsibilities/labels) to the appropriate category.
- Set the [Milestone](https://github.com/intarchboard/responsibilities/milestones) to the meeting at which this task will be reported. Generally, this should be the next full board meeting.

## How do I add an item to a meeting agenda?

1. Determine when you want to discuss your topic. Items must be added to an agenda no later than the Friday before a meeting.
1. On your [issue](https://github.com/intarchboard/responsibilities/issues), add a comment with the [Agenda Template](https://github.com/intarchboard/responsibilities/blob/main/Templates.md).
1. Add a link to your issue in the wiki [here](https://wiki.ietf.org/group/iab/Agenda).
1. The IAB Chair or Secretariat will send a copy of the agenda to the mailing list and Slack after the agenda is finalized (the Friday before the meeting).

## How do I report the outcome of a discussion?

If your issue is discussed at a meeting (an informal meeting, full board meeting, or a side/committee meeting),
the outcome and notes of the discussion should be documented on the issue.

Use the [Outcome Template](https://github.com/intarchboard/responsibilities/blob/main/Templates.md) to add
a comment on your issue.

## Reviewing and closing items

At each informal and full board meeting, we will briefly review this tracker to make sure that each IAB
member has the appropriate assignments for the next milestone.

Once a task has been reported, the issue can be closed.

For activity between meetings, please open a new issue to track the work for the next meeting. The new issue can refer back to the old issue.
