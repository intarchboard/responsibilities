# IAB Responsibilities Tracking

This repository tracks the responsibilities and tasks assigned to IAB members
between board meetings. See details on the [committee model](https://wiki.ietf.org/group/iab/committee-model).

See the current year's full board meeting schedule [here](https://wiki.ietf.org/group/iab/2025_Schedule).

An overview of all tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/intarchboard/projects/2/views/1).

## How should I use this tracker?

- Create an [Issue](https://github.com/intarchboard/responsibilities/issues) to track a task or responsibility that you or others will work on between full board meetings.
- Assign one or more IAB members to the issue.
- Set the [Label](https://github.com/intarchboard/responsibilities/labels) to the appropriate category.
- Set the [Milestone](https://github.com/intarchboard/responsibilities/milestones) to the meeting at which this task will be reported. Generally, this should be the next full board meeting.

Provide updates on meetings, discussions, etc, on the issue page.

At each full board meeting, we will review this tracker to make sure that each IAB member has the appropriate assignments for the next milestone.

Prior to each full board meeting, each issue in the corresponding milestone should be updated to include a written report to be presented to the IAB, including any actions that the full IAB should take. This can also be a pointer to a report provided on a mailing list, etc.

Once a task has been reported, the issue can be closed.

For activity between meetings, please open a new issue to track the work for the next meeting. The new issue can refer back to the old issue.
